Experience
======
* **Researcher**, _Cooperation with Prof. Boyu Wang, Western University_, Jun 2018 - Present
  * Research about decoding in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface using deep learning and applying transfer learning framework onto certain SOTA networks in CV (2018-2019)
  * Research about application of differential privacy in machine learning and transfer learning framework (2020)

* **Research Assistant**, _Under Prof. Jimmy Lee's Supervision, The Chinese University of Hong Kong_, Jan 2019 - May 2019
  * Research on the project - _Detecting Similarities of Computer Programs in Generalized Languages_
  * Aimed at studying current SOTA techniques in detecting similarities of computer programs
  * Adapted and adopted suitable techniques for detecting similarities in programs in a text-based form
  * Proposed novel methods in similarity measurement of vectors
  * Made an oral defense

* **Machine Learning Algorithm Engineer**, _Supervisor: Dr. Jinfeng Yi, Machine Learning Lab, JD.com AI Research, Beijing \& Nanjing_, Jun 2018 - Aug 2018
  * Took charge of an automatic customer service project in its second phase, discovered a better classiﬁcation strategy using data mining technique, improved the theoretical performance from 20% to around 80% with slight compromise
  * Designed and realized the advertising system in no-salesman stores using cameras to classify potential customers, and then applying strategies to display corresponding goods onto the advertising screens
  * Designed an importance weighting mechanism in certain sorting algorithms to reduce time complexity

Projects
======
  * **AI Player for Game Saboteur**, Jan 2020 - May 2020

    * Decision tree pruned by human's experience
    * Ranked top 20\% among all competitors
    * Written report with distinction

  * **Identity Finder**, Nov 2018
    * Aimed at helping ﬁnd the children that lost in their early ages
    * Trained a CNN in PyTorch to measure the similarities between proﬁles in people’s diﬀerent ages
    * Made a UI in PyQt for users to upload paired pictures as inputs to the trained model
    * Test case precision 90%+

  * **Lambda Calculus Interpreter of an XML-style Language**, Jan 2018 - May 2018
