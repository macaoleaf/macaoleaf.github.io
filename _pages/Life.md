I'm a fan of music. Although I have not received any theoretical training in music, I am strongly interested in its beats and how to perform it using vocal technique. I used to be a professional Music Game player (not a top one though) - check out some of my best plays if interested! I have uploaded them both on bilibili and YouTube: [Stepmania (PC) [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av67422894/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mtCqDasRP4&t=332s)] [乐动时代 (Tablet) [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av67417951/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozFUyi3ZzOI)]

I'm also a sporty guy, who is crazy about playing table tennis. I've been in the varsity team of McGill throughout my undergraduate time, and during my exchange in CUHK, I also played for the college team and won the gold medal [[pic](/images/TTCUHK.jpg)]. As an amateur player who hasn't received decent training until high school time, I'm pretty satisfied with my achievement so far. I enjoy both playing matches and doing trick shots, and I would enjoy the most if I can combine both occationally. Luckily I do have some of them recorded: [Backhand around-the-net shot [vid](/images/backhand_ATN.mp4)]
