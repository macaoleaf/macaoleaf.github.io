I'm a fan of music. Although I have not received any theoretical training in music, I am strongly interested in its beats and how to perform it using vocal technique. I used to be a professional Music Game player (not a top one though) - check out some of my best plays if interested! I have uploaded them both on bilibili and YouTube: [Stepmania (PC) [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av67422894/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mtCqDasRP4&t=332s)] [乐动时代 (Tablet) [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av67417951/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozFUyi3ZzOI)]

I'm also a sporty guy. I'm in the varsity team of McGill throughout my undergraduate time, and during my exchange in CUHK, I also played for the college team and won the gold medal. [[pic](/images/TTCUHK.jpg)]
