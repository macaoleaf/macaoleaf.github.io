Although I have not received any theoretical training in music, I am strongly interested in its beats and how to perform it using vocal technique. I used to be a professional Music Game player (not a top one though). Check out some of my best games if interested! I have uploaded them both on bilibili and YouTube: [Stepmania (PC) [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av67422894/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mtCqDasRP4&t=332s)] [乐动时代 (Tablet) [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av67417951/) [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozFUyi3ZzOI)]
